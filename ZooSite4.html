  <h2>Farm Sheep</h2>

  <p>A key distinction between our farm sheep and wild sheep is that wild sheep shed, but farm sheep won't shed and their hair will endlessly keep growing. Sheep are great at recognizing faces, distinguishing between some basic facial expressions, and much more. But more importantly they're also great at being fluffy and adorable.</p>
