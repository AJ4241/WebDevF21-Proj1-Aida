  <p>We just saw the biggest animal on the world, now let's learn about this species of wild cat which is the smallest cat in the world. It is said to be so small that it can actually fit in the palm of your hand, and if you still aren't sure of how small it is, just watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W86cTIoMv2U">this video</a> and see how small it is when it stands next to the leaf. This isn't a cuddly cat, and it's definitely not small and weak. It's a wild animal just like a tiger, and it's got great hunting skills.</p>
