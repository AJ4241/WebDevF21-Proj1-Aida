  <p>Mourning doves are a commonly seen bird in NYC. They make a sound that sounds really similar to an owl's hoots. They tend to have 2 babies per brood, and these birds have the cutest waddle when they walk. A pair of these birds actually started a family right under my AC and I got a chance to watch their babies hatch and grow (and both babies succesfully grew up to the point where they could fly out of the nest).The top picture is the mama dove with her babies on either side of her, and the bottom picture is just the two babies chilling.</p>
